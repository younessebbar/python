# The function should return True if it is passed "pickle" as one of the args
# Otherwise it should return False

# It should accept any number of arguments
# It should return a count of how many args are less than or equal to 50

# ============== PART 3 ============== 
# Write a function called get_top_students that helps teachers find their A-grade students!

# It should return a list containing the names of students who scored 90 or above
