# Tuple is an immutable, ordered collection
#  Like lists tuples are ordered, indexed collections
#  But tuples are immutable, they cannot change once created

dishes = ("Taco", "Fajitas", "burrito", "quesadilla")

empty_tuple = ()
empty_tuple = tuple()

# 1 element tuple

# single_tuple = ("First") this doesn't work because python confuses it with a normal parenthesis operator which evaluates what's inside of it
single_tuple = "First"
single_tuple = ("First", )
